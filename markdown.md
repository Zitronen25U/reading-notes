**Here's What I've learned about mastering markdown**

Markdown is critical to all github pages. Using HTML is possible as well, but for the purpose of this class we wont
Markdown needs constant practice to improve on
Creating a GitHub page is relativley easy to do, but also easy to screw up (I know, I tried at least 3 times).
Markdown can really offer a lot of cool customization to a website. Heres some helpful things I've learned along the way.

Lists are really easy to make, and turn into different types of lists. They're made with a simple minus, plus, or astrix (-,+,*) and are incredibly helpful!

Putting images onto your page is done with the same method of referencing pages, but you just add an !. This simply looks like this:

![]()

***Thats It! It really makes the page pop*** 

Turning lists into checklists can make your todo tasks so much easier, and can help you keep track of your own goals. You first have to creat a list, then use the bracket keys with a space in between [ ]! In order to check it off, simply put an x in the brackets.

Quoting simply uses the > key and can be helpful for referencing things like websites, or just quotes in general.

But I think my favorite thing that I could teach someone would be text sizes. Simply using the # key can really emphasize your text! Its quite simple too, 1#, 2#, or 6# can really make your webpage pop, or it wont.

I think this about covers the things I find most important in this first lesson on markup.

Some stuff I do need to focus on moving forwar is:

 - Spelling
 - Attention to detail
 - PRACTICING MUCH MUCH MORE
