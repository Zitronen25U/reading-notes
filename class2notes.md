### Understanding GIT

- Github uses GIT. 

- Allows multiple devs to work on same code

- view reply and remove changes

- Manage project under 1 repository 

### Commits

- Commit = represents each successive version of a file or files (a perfect snapshot)

- Each commit has a label that points to a "HEAD" 

- Head meaning "YOU ARE HERE"

- A git takes a snapshot, your head is your current version. 

- Each snapshot gets a commit message
