Reading PG 46-59 Javascript book

## Notes on Reading

- HTML = content layer
- CSS = presentation layer
- JS = behavioral layer

### Holy cow that reading lesson 06A kinda sucked to do on my own

- The biggest issue I had was honestly reading the instructions in the book. The author was a little confusing on his instructions, and unfortunately I think the class repo didn't have the full notes.

- But once I learned I had to make both an html and js script based off the notes, I quickly figured it out. 

- My biggest issue is with scripts. I keep forgetting to write the ref. for the script inside the brackets.

## writing js in my page

- Not many notes today. Just really observed some scripts that roger has shown. Am gonna google some scripts for the lab myself!
