# Java Script

What is Javascript 

Makes your page functional
Stores variables, iterate through arrays. Its a programming language

- Variables = the temporary storage of something

var name = 'Brian'

name = 'Stacy'
console.log(name + 'is your instructor')

Stacy is your instructor

Reading PG 46-59 Javascript book

## Notes on Reading

- HTML = content layer
- CSS = presentation layer
- JS = behavioral layer

### Holy cow that reading lesson 06A kinda sucked to do on my own

- The biggest issue I had was honestly reading the instructions in the book. The author was a little confusing on his instructions, and unfortunately I think the class repo didn't have the full notes.

- But once I learned I had to make both an html and js script based off the notes, I quickly figured it out. 

- My biggest issue is with scripts. I keep forgetting to write the ref. for the script inside the brackets.

## writing js in my page

- Not many notes today. Just really observed some scripts that roger has shown. Am gonna google some scripts for the lab myself!


## How Computers Work!

### BILL BILL BILL GATES

- Solid intro Bill. None of us know how computers work

### What makes a computer a computer

- how does it work?
    - My dad worked with Nat on the xbox team. Small world
    - machines that manipulate information


- 4 different tasks of all computers

    - input
    - storage
    - processing
    - output

### Binary and Data

- no one deals with binary actually
- electric wires and circuts. 
- Signal can be on, or off. Yes or no. 1 or 0
- The Binary Number System
    - any number is represented with 1's and 0's  

### Circuts and Logic

- can take multiple signals and combine them to give diff results
- all information processing your computer does is done by circuts

### CPU, Memory, Input, Output

- Input
    - Keyboard, camera, mic etc
    - Sends input to CPU in binary
- CPU 
    - calculates how to give input.
    - requests how to from memory
- Memory
    - gives how to CPU and stores future info
- Output
    - CPU gives data to output device

### Hardware and Software

- hardware = physical things of computers. 
- software = code 
- CPU is master controller
- sends and receive informaiton
- knows which circuts to use and when to use them
- Binary commands stored in memory and executes them in sequence 
- modern day programming consists of commands stored in memory. 

### Operating System

- BILL BILL BILL BILL GATES. He was mad flexing on that interview. I made microsoft, which MOST PEOPLE USE BTW. Lol get recked apple
- Anyway, The OS is the software controller by loading things into computers memory
