# Choosing a text editor

Here's my notes on choosing a text editor for coding!

## Comand Lines

The command line is easily the most important GUI of a system. It is a plain text input that runs commands. I'ts that simple.

The command line consists of of the two parts

- The Shell

- The Output

This typically looks something like this

User@Bash: 1+1

total 2

**You will notice that line one consits of the input, the shell, and line two is the generated output from that input.**

## Basic Commands

Learning every line of code can be challenging, but there are many commands that will give you a good base in terms of executables and navigation. Here's a good base to start with

Each of the following can be used inputed into the CLI, and I will describe what each does

pwd : lists the current preset

ls : lists the directory in a short list

~ : refers to home directory

. : refers to current directory

.. : refers to the parent directory

At the end of the day, there are many tools that can help you get started with working on a command line interface. These tools that I listed are basic, but provide a good base to learning.

## Choosing The Right Text Editor

When choosing an editor, it is important to choose one that works for you, and will fit the need of your desired outcome. Personally, I've used Visual Studio Code in the past, because it integrates incredibly well with my windows computer, and allows a range of functionallity.

When choosing however, there are many different needs that you need to consider such as customization, software compatability, and just overall user friendliness. The choice however, is really up to you as the user
