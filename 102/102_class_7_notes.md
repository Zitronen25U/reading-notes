# Class 7 Notes

## JS Review

datatypes
- string = 'brian' or "brian" can use both, but be consistent
- number = 1,2,3,4 etc
    - '45' != 45 

- using == compares values. IE 45 == 45
- using === compares value and datatype. IE '45' === 45 would not be true. compared string and number

- String, number, boolie
- arrays and objects are a thing

## PG 74-79, Expressions

Expressions evaluate into (results in) a single value. 
Two Types
+ Expressions that just assign a value to a variable
+ Expressions that use two or more values to return to a single value

1) var color = 'beige'; this is one value 
2) var area = 3 * 2; these are two values that turn into one, aka 3 x 2= 6

Expressions rely on things called operators which allow us to create one value from one or more values.

### Arithmetic Operators

- addition + 
- subtration - 
- division / 
- multiplicatio * 
- increment ++
- decrement --
- modulus %

### String Operator 
- the + is used to joing strings: 
    - var firstName = 'Ivy ';
    - var lastName = 'Stone ';
    - var fullName = firstName + lastName;

## Functions

What is a function?
- lets you group a series of statments together to perfom a specific task. 

To make a function, you first give it a name and then write the statments needed to achieve its task inside the curly brackets

function sayHello() {
    document.write("hello!");
}

- The function name is sayHello()

### Declaring functions that need information
 
 funcitons sometimes need specific information to perform its task. 
 - give it parameters. These act like variables

function getArea(width, height) {
    return widtch * height;
}

parameters are width and height
