# Lesson 3 Notes

### Understanding GIT

- Github uses GIT. 

- Allows multiple devs to work on same code

- view reply and remove changes

- Manage project under 1 repository 

### Commits

- Commit = represents each successive version of a file or files (a perfect snapshot)

- Each commit has a label that points to a "HEAD" 

- Head meaning "YOU ARE HERE"

- A git takes a snapshot, your head is your current version. 

- Each snapshot gets a commit message


### GitHub

- Share code with others

- online place to store code

- review changes

- keep changes seperate until you want to add them

- Have lots of people working on code at the same time

- keep a history of each file over time

- can run into a merge conflict. GET HELP ASAP

### Repositories 

- Usually 1 project = 1 repository 

### Linking repositories 

- connected repo's can receive code from eachother

- "cloning"

- ^ Brings changes from github, to local computer file

- Click clone w/ https. HOW TO BELOW

1 Open terminal

2 "cd documents"


- WATCHING THIS VIDEO IS NUTS

- ADD, COMMITT, PUSH

- Check status with "Git status"

- "git add (filename) "

-"git commit" "git commit -m (message)" (leaves message on commit)

# THIS WILL NOT UPDATE ONLINE VERSION

- "git push" will push from local to github (It asked me to login, and the push origin master command didnt work. Just git push)
