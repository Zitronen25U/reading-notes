# Class 07 Notes

## How I explained REST to my brother

### So how does the web work?

- HTTP MAN. (heyper text transmission protocol cause I'm a nerd and know that)

### WWW is built on REST

- provides definition of a "resource" which is what helps point you in the right direction

- being able to talk to any machine in the world was the primary concern of initial design 

- the url is important. It's a universal address for a million different languages of web design

### Verbs?

- Plymorphism
  - browser does a get url request for all these differnt verbs in different languages

## LocationIQ

- a map API 

## Weatherbit API

- A (wait for it) weather API! GIves weather data

## YELP!

- Everyone knows what yelp is.

- BUT DID YOU KNOW ITS AN API AS WELL!?!?

## The Movie Database!

- totally the best API full of lots of movies that are totally cool movies.
