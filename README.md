## Here's my notes on class 1! 


### Lets talk about Growth Mindset

What are some ways I can have a good growth mindset, and what it means to me?

To me, having a growth mindset means

- Being willing to put in daily work

- Taking good notes

- Asking questions

**To me, growing takes work** :ok_hand: 
In order to grow you really need to focus on working hard to improve yourself. We all have flaws and all struggle with new topics, but asking questions and working hard typically can make you better at any subject.

***Growing takes work. Work is hard, but learning new skills is incredibly rewarding***
