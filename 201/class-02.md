- variables >var is a declared data storage

- Statements; a set of instructions

- Rules for naming variables
    - name must begin with letter, $, or _
    - can contain letters, numbers, dollar sign, or underscore
    - cannot use keywords or reserved words
    - all variables are case sensative
    - use variables that describe the kind of information youre storing
    - use capital letters for every word after the 1st word

- Array's 
    - stores a list of value

- IF statements
    - if statement passes check, it returns a true value

- Else checks condition 
    - if it resolves to true, the first code block is exec.
    - if resolves false, runs 2nd block of code
