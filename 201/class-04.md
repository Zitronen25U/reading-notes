# Reading Notes for Lesson 4

## Links

- links reference other pages 
  - created using the <a> tag
  - > <a href= "link">text user clicks on</a>

- uses directory structure to link to others sites within the same page

- email links
  - mailto:email

- open link in new window
  - combine href and website, and add a target=" after it

## Layout

- CSS and building blocks
  - treats each HTML element as its own seperate block

### positioning elements

- normal flow. 
  - every block appears on a new line
  - will lower all items down the page
  
- Relative positioning
  - shifts to the top, left, right, or bottom from where normal flow would place it.
  - does not affect position of surrounding elements

- Absolute 
  - positions the element in relation to its containing element
  - does not affect surrounding elements
  - move as users scroll up and down the page

- Fixed positioning
  - Form of absolute
  - do not move with user scrolls

- Floating
  - allows you to take that elemetn out of normal flow and position it to the far left or right of a containing box.

### Creating Layouts

- When creating layouts, many things need to be considered
  - Size of display
  - Resolution
  - page size
  - device being used
  - All of these can affect your layout decisions

- Fixed widtch layout
  - Does not change sizes as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser

- Liquid Layouts
  - contract and stretch to the users size of their browser
  - Design can become flawed if user manipulates the page

- Layout Grids
  - Many designers use a grid structure to help them position items on a page

## Functions, Methods, and Objects

### Functions

- consist of a series of statements that have been grouped together because they perform a specific task
- can give a name later to "call" the function into use again
- declaring a function
  - > function functionName
- Calling a function
  - > functionName

- Can set parameters for functions
  - > functionName(X,Y){
   > return X * Y;
  > }
