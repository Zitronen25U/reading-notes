### Transforms

- transform property comes in two settings,
  - 2D
  - 3D

- accepts a handful of values
  - rotate
  - scale
  - translate
  - skew
  - You can combine transformations
  - transform-origin is used to transform off of the point of origin
  - perspective

### Transitions and Animations:

- Can use transitions without JS or flash
- alters appearence and behavior of an element whenever a state change occurs

- there are 4 properties

1. transitoin-property
2. transition-duration
3. transition-timing-function
4. transition-delay

- these properties are part of the **vendor prefixes** which is simplified versions of code. 
- it **CAN** be written out, but it would be stupid to do so

- All of these can be utilized to create animations within CSS and HTML locally

### Project Aristotle

- reviewed a half centruy of academic studies looking at how teams worked.
- Wanting to figure out what the best teams were. 
- typically they had been placing similar minded people in the same teams
- after much research, they came to the conclusion that the **"who"** aspect of the team didn't matter

- it didn't matter if people were friends, or if they were strangers, groups showed pretty equal results

- they came to the conclusion that influencing group "norms" mattered more than the groups themselves

- some of the norms that they found were the most helpful were
  - allowing groups to consist of different types of people.
  - allowing the groups to be more social, which may look less productive, but it allows a working relationship with their peers
  - allowing groups to not only focus on tasks. Going off on tangents in meetings for example let everyone feel as though their voice was heard

> ‘As long as everyone got a chance to talk, the team did well. But if only one person or a small group spoke all the time, the collective intelligence declined.’

- this was a key teakeaway from the project that they found
