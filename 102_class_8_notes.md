### PG 150-151

**Comparing Operators: Evaluating Conditoins** 

You can evaluate a situation by comparing values. The result will be a Boolean: True, or false

- == equal to
- != not equal to
- === strict equal to
- !== Strict not equal to
- '>' greater than
- '<' less than
- '>= greater than or equal to
- '<= less than or equal to 

### Pg 156

**Logical Operators** 

- comparison operators usually return single values of true or false
- logical operators allow you to compare results of more than one comparison operator

((5<2> && (w >= 3))

^expression     ^expression
    false            false


- && Logical And
- '||' logical or
- ! logical not

### pg 170

### **LOOPS** 

Looops check a condition. If it returns true, a code block will run.
then the condition will be checked again and if it still returns true, the code block will run again. It repeats until the condition returns 

- FOR
    - If you need to run code a specifi number of times, use a *FOR* loop
- While 
    - If you do not know how many times the code should run, use the *while* loop
- Do while
    - similar to while, but will always run the statements, even if its value is false

### **Loop Counters**

- Initialization
    - create a variable and set it to 0
    - variable commonly called 'i'
    - var i = 0;

- condition 
    - The loops should continue to run until the counter reaches a specified number
    - i < 10

- update 
    - every time the loop has run the statements in the curly brackets, it adds one to the counter
    - i++
    - ads a + for each time its run


### Looping

for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    document.write(i)
}

This add 1 to the variable i everytime the loop is run

### using while loops

- continues to run the loop until its no longer true
